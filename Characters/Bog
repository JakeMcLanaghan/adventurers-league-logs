https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2188379-hook-of-fishers-delight 
Extra: Chwinga Charm of Snowball Strike (Awarded to @(Charlie)  Evrandle) :This charm has 5 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the charm‚Äôs charges to create a magical snowball in your hand and throw it. You must have a hand free to hold the snowball, or the charge is wasted. The snowball is a magic ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, it deals 1d4 cold damage on a hit, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you score a critical hit with the snowball, the target is blinded until the end of its next turn. The snowball vanishes immediately after you hit or miss with it, or at the end of your turn if you don‚Äôt throw it. Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.

Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden
A creature hit with a Chardalyn weapon must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving hrow or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. 
A character who claims one or more of these weapons can be corrupted by them. Each day at dawn, roll a d6 for each such weapon in the character‚Äôs possession. On a roll of 1, the character must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become an evil NPC under the DM‚Äôs control, unless the character is evil already. This alignment change can be undone by any magic that ends a curse, but after ten days, it can be reversed only by a wish spell or divine intervention.
