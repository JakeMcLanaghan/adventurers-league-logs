**DM:** Rebecca
**Date:** 2023-06-14
**Location:** The Wolf and Hound
**Adventure: **The Secrets of Skyhorn Lighthouse
**Players:** Ayman (Valentine), Paul (Jack Altray), Gabe (Torden Galeson), Jake (Artix), and Brad (Asteric Zotos)
**Rewards:** 
-Level Up Opportunity and 10 downtime days
||-1,335 GP each
-Potion of Water Breathing (consumable, uncommon)
 *You can breathe underwater for 1 hour after drinking this potion. Its cloudy green fluid smells of the sea and has a jellyfish-like bubble floating in it.*

-Bead of Force (consumable, rare)
*This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.
An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.*

-Dagger of Venom (rare)
*You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.*

-Mariner's Coin (uncommon)
*The coin is a hammered copper piece stamped with a shining lighthouse. When presented to non-hostile sailors, it grants advantage on one Charisma check to influence them.*||

Thanks all for a fun game.  I might just have to run the sequel soon, The Corruption of Skyhorn Lighthouse.
