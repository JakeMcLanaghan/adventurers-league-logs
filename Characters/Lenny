Notes:
The characters returned the Orb of Living Water to Rydah, the high priestess of Umberlee, along with her acolyte Zhara.  With the magical healing administered by Lenny, Zhara was able to recover from the ‘brainwashing’ she received from the Cult of the Crushing Wave.  Six days after their return to Mulmaster, Dannika Nishom visits the characters at Sailor’s Haven, informing the characters her father’s agents have returned with information about her brother’s resurrection.

Treasure:
400 gold pieces each.

Magic Items:
Trident of Warning
Weapon, uncommon (requires attunement)
This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.
