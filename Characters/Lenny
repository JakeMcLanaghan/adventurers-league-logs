Date: June 24, 2023
Players: Jake (Lenny), Sam (Karkan), Cooper (Tremblay), & Stanly (Alset)
Rewards: Level Up & 10 downtime days.

Notes:
The characters returned the Orb of Living Water to Rydah, the high priestess of Umberlee, along with her acolyte Zhara.  With the magical healing administered by Lenny, Zhara was able to recover from the ‘brainwashing’ she received from the Cult of the Crushing Wave.  Six days after their return to Mulmaster, Dannika Nishom visits the characters at Sailor’s Haven, informing the characters her father’s agents have returned with information about her brother’s resurrection.

Treasure:
400 gold pieces each.

Magic Items:
Trident of Warning
Weapon, uncommon (requires attunement)
This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.

Location: The Wolf & Hound
Date: July 8, 2023
Players: Paul (Jack), Harrison (Gnash), Jake (Lenny), David (Braken), Stanley (Alset), and Sam (Gavril).
Rewards: Level Up & 10 downtime days.

Notes:
A Father’s Love and Failure.  Drasvoc Nishom blamed himself for the corruption of his son’s soul in the Nine Hells, and the eventual rebirth of his son as the Dark Paladin.  As a result, he entered a state of depression.  Dannika, this only daughter, took over as the Head of the Nishom family.

Cult of the Black Earth.  Daria, blinded by her love for her husband (Alystar Nishom) and under the false belief her husband’s soul was still bound to the material plane (the yellow rose), fell prey to the Cult of the Black Earth (dedicated to Ogremoch, the Elemental Prince of Evil Earth).  The Cult of the Black Earth convinced Daria they could resurrect Alystar with their elemental magic.

Forgiveness.  The Nishom family forgave Daria, as they understood her actions were motivated by her love for her husband.

A Madman’s Suffering Ended.  Artimus, once a renown warlock and seasoned adventurer, had been seduced by Jeny Greenteeth, and driven to a state of madness and desperation by his love for her.  The characters confronted Artimus at Jeny’s cabin in the Quivering Forest.  When confronted, Artimus was weeping uncontrollably and in a state of utter madness.  The characters ended Artimus’ suffering by ending his life.

The Dream.  The adventure ended with a shared dream the characters had.  In the dream, the characters were following Jeny’s trial through the mist.  The trial led to a gothic mansion, where a masquerade ball was taking place…

Lady Marilena’s Soul.  Lady Marilena let out a cry for help when Jeny collected her soul.  As Jeny was fading away with her ‘prize’, the characters heard Jeny whisper the following words: ‘The young girl Sari was my first choice…  But your soul, my dear Lady Marilena, has a very special quality to it….’

The Fortune Teller.  The fortune teller arrived at the tavern/town hall in Kabel’s Hill for the second time.  The fortune teller presented the characters with a deck of strangely illustrated cards.  Each character drew a card from the deck.  Two types of cards were drawn: a card with an illustration of the snakeman was drawn with the greatest frequency, followed by the one with the raven.
